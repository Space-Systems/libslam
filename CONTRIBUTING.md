# Introduction

libslam is used in many of IRAS software projects. Developers of such software projects normally want to use and modify lisblam. They add functionality to it, improve existing functions and fix bugs. The problem:

1. They don't want to be bothered by other developers using lisblam.
2. They want to use all the updates other developers using libslam do.

This description shall bring order into this mess.

# Branches

On github/Space-Systems, there is one **master branch** named "master" which contains the most recent version of libslam. Each separate change to libslam shall be done in its own **change branch** named "<Developer Abbreviation>/<Change Name>" where "<Devloper Abbreviation> must be your official abbreviation in lower-case (e. g. "jr" or "anh") and "<Change Name>" must be something like "fix_nxtbuf". Please always use underscores ("_") for word separation.

Each branch has at least one owner. Owner of the master branch is SvM (deputy: ChK). Owner of a change branch is the developer working on the change which is supposed to be introduced. The developer abbreviation in a change branch name indicates the owner of the branch. **Only the owner of a branch may push changes to his/her branch on github/Space-Systems.**

# Making a Change

## Working in your Change Branch

You can make a change in the world (of libslam)! Here is what you have to do - assuming you are "SvM" and you want to "fix_nxtbuf":

Clone libslam git:

```
mkdir libslam-git
cd libslam-git
git clone http://github/Space-Systems/libslam/libslam.git .
```


If you use an already-existing local git repository instead:

```
cd libslam-git
git checkout master
git pull --ff-only
```

Note that you are, in both cases, in the master branch now. Create a new change branch based on master:

```
git branch svm/fix_nxtbuf
git checkout svm/fix_nxtbuf
```

NOTE: You are encouraged to create change branches for each change that you want to introduce to libslam - even if it is a small one. The smaller the change, the easier the merge at the end. As a result: The smaller the change, the sooner your change will arrive in libslam master.

If you are working on an "official" libslam issue in gitlab, you can use the "New branch" button there to create your change branch off the issue. However, the button will directly create a branch with the issue's number and title in its name (You can't choose another name). The title of an issue does not always name the change that actually needs to be done and there could be more than one change necessary to close the issue. Also, your abbreviation is missing in the branch name. So, this is bullocks. Interestingly though, gitlab will ask for the name of the new branch if a branch with the automatically-generated name already exists. So, you are welcome to:
1. Click on "New branch"
1. Go back to the issue
1. Click on "New branch" again
1. Change the branch name
1. Go to the branch with the "wrong" name
1. Delete the branch with the "wrong" name

After this you can clone the libslam git as shown above and then checkout your branch:

```
git checkout svm/3_fix_nxtbuf
```

Or, if you are using an already-existing repository:

```
git fetch
git checkout svm/3_fix_nxtbuf
```

Supposedly, you already noted the "3" in the branch name. This is the issue number of this example. Please always put your issue number into the name as shown above (if you are working on an "official" issue).

Now, let's continue. Make your changes and commit them:

```
(Change, for example, slam_io.f90)
git add slam_io.f90
git commit
```
**All commit messages must be prefixed by "svm/fix_nxtbuf: "**

**Always be compliant to libslam's [code conventions](Code conventions)**. If you are not, you will have to make your code compliant later anyhow. So, it's always better to be compliant from the start. The more compliant you are from the beginning, the sooner your changes will be merged into master.

NOTE: Each commit should cover a (small) change. Please don't put two different changes into one and the same commit. The commit message should summarize the change.

Afterwards, push your branch to github/Space-Systems:

```
git push --set-upstream origin svm/fix_nxtbuf
```

After your inital push, you can do further pushes with only:

```
git push
```

NOTE: If you pushed before, but it doesn't work anymore it may be the case that your branch has already been merged into master and then removed from github/Space-Systems! In this case, if something is missing, please follow the instructions under "Quick-Fixing" beneath.

You can make as many adds, commits and pushes as you like and over a period of time as long as you like. You can also work on more than one change in parallel. In any case, it is your responsibility to always stay up-to-date with master! To accomplish this, you need to **rebase on master**. This means the following:

1. Your commits on master are temporarily put aside.
1. Your change branch is set equal to master.
1. Each of your commits is transformed into a new commit on master one after another. This new commit will be the same as the old one by default. But in the case of conflicts, you will need to resolve the conflict which makes the new commit different from the old one.

In simple words, what you want to do by rebasing is to introduce your changes one by one again, based on the new version of master. So, you rebase your branch on the (new) top of master. This will lead to a cleaner history in the end. Translated into commands, this means you have to first do the rebase itself:

```
git checkout master
git pull --ff-only
git checkout svm/fix_nxtbuf
git rebase master
```

If a conflict occurs, you will be asked to resolve it. In the conflicted file you will find something like:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
configure_file(src/slam.h.in src/slam.h) # COMMENT FROM CHANGE BRANCH svm/something
=======
configure_file(src/slam.h.in src/slam.h) # COMMENT FROM CHANGE BRANCH svm/fix_nxtbuf
>>>>>>> e5f2061... svm/fix_nxtbuf: Fixed nxtbuf
```

In this case a comment beginning with "#" was added in another change branch named "svm/something" to the same code line in CMakeLists.txt. Note that you will normally not see the branch name of the other change branch. It has been added here to the comment for explanatory purposes. "HEAD" is the new HEAD of your change branch = master HEAD + commits put ontop of it up to the current commit which produced the conflict. You now need to resolve the conflict like normal and then continue with the rebase. For example:

```
(Change CMakeLists.txt)
git add CMakeLists.txt
git rebase --continue
```

Here, it is possible that git tells you that you can't continue, since no changes have been commited. In this case, one possible explanation is that you erased your own changes made to CMakeLists.txt in the currently-processed commit. If that is the case and it was intended as such, use the following command instead of the continue command to proceed:

```
(Change CMakeLists.txt)
git add CMakeLists.txt
git rebase --skip
```

NOTE: If, after a rebase, you are adviced by git to pull changes: Don't. It's a trap!

After the rebase, you need to push your changes to github/Space-Systems. A simple push will not do the trick this time, but the following will:

```
git push origin +svm/fix_nxtbuf
```

Note the "+"! This makes this push a force push which overwrites your branch on github/Space-Systems completely - including its history. DO NOT use "--force" or "-f" instead, since this may lead to a force push of all branches!

## Creating a Merge Request


As soon as you think your change is ready to be incorporated into master, you need to make a **merge request**:

1. Check if your code is compilable and conforms to the [code conventions](Code conventions).
1. Open github/Space-Systems's gitlab web interface under http://github/Space-Systems and login.
1. Click on "libslam / libslam" project.
1. Click on "branches".
1. Click on "Merge request" next to your change branch.
1. Set "Asignee" to master owner.
1. Click on "Submit merge request".

With this, the master owner should be notified by a brown marker at the top-right of github/Space-Systems's gitlab web interface. He/She will:

1. Look at your commits.
1. Pull and checkout your change branch
1. Compile
1. Run the tests.

## Merge Request Acceptance

If everything is fine, the master owner will merge your change branch into master as-is. In this case:

1. The master owner will notify you about the merge.
1. The master owner creates a new tag, thereby increasing libslam's version number.
1. The master owner removes your change branch from github/Space-Systems.
1. You must remove your change branch from your local system/repository.

## Merge Request Iteration

If, however, your change needs... changes or clarification, the master owner will:

1. Add comments to your merge request.
1. Set the assignee of the merge request to you. This will make the brown merge request notifier pop up in your own gitlab view.

Then, please:

1. Open the merge request yourself in gitlab.
1. You will be able to see the comments by scrolling down there. Read the comments.

You are able to comment on your merge request yourself. If you think, the next step should be for the master owner to look at your comments:

1. In the merge request, click on "Edit".
1. Change the "Assignee" back to the master owner.

If now, your merge request is accepted by the master owner, see above. In any case, you can (and - depending on the comments - should):

1. Make further adds, commits and pushes (and rebases!) to your change branch. These new changes will be added to your existing merge request. You don't have to create a new merge request.
1. Set the "Assignee" of the merge request (back) to the master owner.

NOTE: It is always possible that you will be asked to do rebases on master by the master owner, before your request can be processed! This will happen as soon as a merge request is accepted before your's.

## Quick-Fixing

If you become aware that your merge request has been accepted, but you forgot something OR if you just want to fix something quickly, you have to do it in a new change branch following the same process as above. However, it doesn't take as long as you might think:

```
git checkout master
git pull --ff-only
git branch svm/quickfix_sth
git checkout svm/quickfix_sth
git add ...
git commit
git push --set-upstream origin svm/quickfix-sth
```

Then, create a merge request for your change branch and set the assignee to the master owner. Done.

TODO: Does commiting to an already-merged branch, rebasing it and pushing work, too?

## Temporary Branches

Your merge request will be processed as soon as possible. If you or your project needs a new version of libslam sooner as the necessary merge requests are processed, you should create a **temporary branch**. If, for example, you need a libslam version for ELKE Project Meeting 4:

```
git checkout master
git branch tmp_elke_pm4
git checkout svm/fix_nxtbuf
git pull
git checkout jr/do_something
git pull
git checkout tmp_elke_pm
git merge svm/fix_nxtbuf
git merge jr/do_something
git push --set-upstream origin tmp_elke_pm
```

If possible, you should always keep working in your own change branches, though, and not in your temporary branch:

```
git checkout svm/fix_nxtbuf
git add ...
git commit
git push
git checkout tmp_elke_pm
git merge svm/fix_nxtbuf
git push
```
